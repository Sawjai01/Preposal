# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Some ideas I have for my final projects will be creating a tic tac toe game, connect four game. Maybe create a chess board game(although this seems a bit hard, but maybe give it a shot!), puzzle games. I'm mostly doing game ideas, since I love gaming. Potientally do want to make my own game. Really thinking about doing flappy bird, LOL.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I do plan on collaborating with some classmates or not. I am not usre yet. But, since I'm a bad coder and not really creative. I would like to have some support from my classmates as it will give me a insight on this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Intense research, and keep practicing.
